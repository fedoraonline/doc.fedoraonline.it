[[File: Gruppo3.jpg | thumb | left | 150px | Test]] We set up a test for the attendees with questions concerning the history and characteristics of Fedora since version 1 and general history related to GNU / Linux as well.

The user who approached to 100% of correct answers won a gadget.

This proof of knowledge and memory was largely successful and was a hard test to pass for the most experienced users; certainly we will make it  more inclusive for the next events. <br/>
