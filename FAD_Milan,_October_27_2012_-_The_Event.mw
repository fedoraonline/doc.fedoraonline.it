== Venue ==
Politecnico di Milano.
As wrote in the wiki we had two classrooms available because while we held some quickly sessions about the contribution in the Fedora Project and the knowledge and tools these activities require, in parallel we held also a pratical packaging session. In our thoughts, this classroom would also served  for a pratical localisation session, but the people wasn't very interested about this demonstration.

== Attendees ==

The event was attended by about 30 people that were very interested to our view of 'free software/open source' and to the concepts that represent Fedora worldwide.
Many people came in and out, but we didn't counted them.

== Presentations ==

The first speech was the introduction to the Project by [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Deneb Marina Latini] which invited all the attendants to contribute, talkin about the groups of interest.
She submitted the activities within The Fedora Project and in particular the ones will be explained in the session.<br/>

The second speech was held by [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Giallu Gianluca Sforna] who treated the packaging (a very interesting session for those who wish understand rpms), explaining how to start making their own rpm and which items are  required to completely agree the Fedora guidelines. He was really clear and the session understandable at all.<br/>
Then Gianluca moved to the second room where he started the pratical session, clear as in the theoric part.<br/>
First he recommended the devolopment tools installation, then he proceeded to illustrate the voices, and their meaning, of the section inside the .spec file, focusing about the importance to have a very well done .spec file, with all the dependencies, following the right Fedora Project rules as well.<br/>
Once tuned the .spec file, Gianluca started with the compiling test, helping those who were in trouble explaining the mistakes they made.<br/>

Then was time for [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Robyduck Robert Mayr] to explain the websites group, telling us which kind of software we need to work with them, which knowledge we must have and wichi tools, as git, we must use.<br/>
He specified the ticketing system on trac to coordinate the workgroup.

The work of the infrastructure team has been treated by [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Averi Andrea Veri], which demonstrated the workflow of this group very interesting.<br/>
He spoke about the software, the operations and the importance of the documentation.<br/>. 

Design group was explained by Samuel Iuri, a young contributor in this team. He told us that design team

== Gadgets ==

There were distributed Fedora 17 DVDs , stickers and copies of a book written by
[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Robyduck Robert Mayr] and [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mailga Gabriele Trombini]

The requests have been in relation to the most various types of objects, but the stickers found the most success.

== Dinner ==

Starting with the aperitif, slightly alcoholic, and then with appetizers of bruschetta and mozzarella rolled in pizza dough.

Then it was pizza time, everyone got his preferred pizza and it was delicious!<br />
As a ''liquid'' support for the whole dinner the most choosed a fresh beer, but we had also some bottles of water on the table.

In the end the cake "Beefy Miracle" has been served, awesome!
