We selected Milan, the rooms within Politecnico, as Venue because we had the possibility to join the Linux Day with our event.

As wrote in the wiki, we held some quickly sessions about the contribution in the Fedora Project and the knowledge and tools these activities require. 

The first speech was the introduction to the Project by [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Deneb Marina Latini] which invited all the attendants to contribute talkin about the groups of interest.
She submitted the activities within The Fedora Project and in particular the ones will be explained in the session.

The second speech was held by [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Giallu Gianlica Sforna] who treated the packaging (a very interesting session for those who wish understand rpms), explaining how to start making their own rpm and which items are  required to completely agree the Fedora guidelines. He was really clear and the session understandable to all. Then Gianluca moved to the second room where he started the pratical session, clear as in the theoric part.
First he recommended the devolopment tools installation, then he proceeded to illustrate the voices, and their meaning, of the section inside the .spec file, focusing about the importance to have a very well done .spec file, with all the dependencies, following the right Fedora Project rules as well.
Once tuned the .spec file, Gianluca started with the compiling test, helping those who were in trouble and explaining their errors.

To explain better why Rome is a unique place in the world you can see these pictures, which confirm we didn't a mistake when choosing this location.

The pizzeria was selected due to the proximity to the public transport and for the space availability for the Fedora 17 presentation and the planned activities.

There was a booth on which we placed the laptop for the demonstration, for the quiz and, also, to place an old but still functioning, IBM laptop.

== Attendees ==

The event was attended by 16 people including some Fedora newbies, with them we had an interesting exchange of views. These were the users requesting to have a look at some standard operations with Gnome3, but also to get introduced to an overview of the system.

== Presentations ==

[[File: Giallu1.jpg | 370px | left | Giallu]] [[File:anto massi gabri.jpg | 370px | right | mailga]] Gianluca Sforna proceeded explaining the new release, with particular reference to the features and improvements occurring in the system, with practical examples, including the terminal usage and the Gnome 3 functionality. <br/>

Gabriele Trombini explains the present activities of the Project, the concept of free software, and the relationship between Fedora Project and Contributors.

[[File: Gruppo3.jpg | thumb | left | 150px | Test]] We set up a test for the attendees with questions concerning the history and characteristics of Fedora since version 1 and general history related to GNU / Linux.

The user who approached the 100% of correct answers won a nice and appreciated gadget.

This proof of knowledge and memory was largely successful and was a hard test to pass also for the most experienced users; certainly we will try make it more tricky for the next events. <br/>

== Gadgets ==

There were distributed Fedora 17 DVDs , stickers and copies of a book written by
[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Robyduck Robert Mayr] and [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mailga Gabriele Trombini]

The requests have been in relation to the most various types of objects, but the stickers found the most success.

== Dinner ==

Starting with the aperitif, slightly alcoholic, and then with appetizers of bruschetta and mozzarella rolled in pizza dough.

Then it was pizza time, everyone got his preferred pizza and it was delicious!<br />
As a ''liquid'' support for the whole dinner the most choosed a fresh beer, but we had also some bottles of water on the table.

In the end the cake "Beefy Miracle" has been served, awesome!
